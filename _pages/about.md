I am a computational designer with a deep interest in machine learning and deep learning and their application in sustainable architecture and structural design. I hold a master's degree in architecture from [Tarbiat Modares University](https://en.modares.ac.ir/) of Tehran. I was honored to work on my thesis project under the supervision of [Dr. Mansour Yeganeh](https://www.modares.ac.ir/en-pro/academic_staff/yeganeh) from Tarbiat Modares University and [Dr. Damon Bolhassani](https://ssa.ccny.cuny.edu/blog/people/damon-bolhassani/) from the City College of New York. Since 2019, I have been sharing my interest in architecture and structures as a registered teacher in the Iran Ministry of Education. Currantly, I am enthusiasticly developing my skills in machine learning and deep learning, and besides that, I am actively looking for a Ph.D. position to continue my education and research in architecture and structural design and how we can leverage the power of AI to explore a more sustainable future.
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
