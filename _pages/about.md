I am a computational designer with a deep interest in machine learning and deep learning and their application in sustainable architecture and structural design. I hold a master's degree in architecture from [Tarbiat Modares University](https://en.modares.ac.ir/) of Tehran. I was honored to work on my thesis project under the supervision of [Dr. Mansour Yeganeh](https://www.modares.ac.ir/en-pro/academic_staff/yeganeh) from Tarbiat Modares University and [Dr. Damon Bolhassani](https://ssa.ccny.cuny.edu/blog/people/damon-bolhassani/) from the City College of New York. Since 2019, I have been sharing my interest in architecture and structures as a registered teacher in the Iran Ministry of Education. Currantly, I am enthusiasticly developing my skills in machine learning and deep learning, and besides that, I am actively looking for a Ph.D. position to continue my education and research in architecture and structural design and how we can leverage the power of AI to explore a more sustainable future.
